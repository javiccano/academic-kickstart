  description = "Designed an innovative multiband feeder with autotracking capability for aeronautic telemetry applications. Concretely, we conceived a patch antenna array in order to feed a parabolic reflector working simultaneously in the S and C frequency bands. This system is expected to provide an error signal that will allow tracking the trajectory of a particular target (autotracking)."

  description = """
  In the last few years, several passive electromagnetic sensors have been reported. Some of these sensors are used for measuring harmful substances, and their response is usually obtained with sophisticated laboratory equipment. This approach highly increases the cost and complexity of the detection system. In this project, a low-cost and portable wireless reading system for passive sensors is designed and manufactured. The reader interrogates the sensors (based on metamaterials) within a short-range radio link, avoiding the direct contact with the substances under test. It is demonstrated, through the wireless measurement of different liquids, that the proposed system can estimate their dielectric permittivity, obtaining a linear approximation with a reduced error. It is noteworthy that the proposed reader can be used with other kinds of electromagnetic sensors, through the monitorization of the target magnitude in the frequency domain."
