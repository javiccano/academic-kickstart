  Researching the security of machine learning in the Dept. of Computing: analyzing the vulnerabilities of machine learning algorithms, designing effective attacks and evaluating their impact, and proposing defenses that can help these algorithms to be more robust to adversaries. Special focus on data poisoning attacks. Techniques developed based on bilevel optimization and Generative Adversarial Networks.

  Assisted in the supervision of 2 MSc (one of them passed with Distinction), 1 MEng, and 1 Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme (UROP) student research projects, and 1 group project (5 students) on data poisoning attacks against machine learning.

  * Study and optimization of a PoC, written in Java language, for the extraction of information from a database warehoused in Hive/Impala (through Hue), and its subsequent transmission, processing and visualisation in Kibana. Other involved technologies were: Apache Maven, Apache Spark, MapReduce, and HDFS.
  * Collaboration in a data migration project: execution, validation and optimization of processes and SQL queries to ETL data warehoused in Hive/Impala (through Hue), according to a pre-established mesh (Control-M).

  Research in communications, radio frequency, antennas and electromagnetic sensors.

  We proposed a novel low-cost and portable IoT reader for passive wireless electromagnetic sensors. An interesting application is the remote measurement of harmful substances. Up to our knowledge, it was the first wireless reader of passive electromagnetic sensors including IoT functionalities (<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s17040693">"An IoT Reader for Wireless Passive Electromagnetic Sensors"</a>).

  As a further step, we designed a novel contactless sensing system composed of a metamaterial-inspired sensor and a reader antenna, in order to detect substances in short distances in real time. This led to a low-cost, replaceable, battery-free and fully passive solution. Moreover, thanks to the short-reading range, the sensor avoids external interferences and undesired radiations (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2018.2826982">"A Contactless Dielectric Constant Sensing System Based on a Split-Ring Resonator-Loaded Monopole"</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.2528/PIERM20051402">"A Contactless System for the Dielectric Characterization of Liquid Drops"</a>).

  On the other hand, we collaborated in an R&D project with an important Spanish telecommunications company (<a href="http://www.prodetel.es/en/">Prodetel, S.A.</a>). Concretely, we designed an innovative multiband feeder for aeronautic telemetry applications.
