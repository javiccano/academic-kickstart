abstract = "A wireless system for the measurement of passive electromagnetic sensors in laboratories is proposed. The system is based on a wireless link, including a signal generator and a signal receiver. It has been applied for the measurement of the relative permittivity of liquids. In order to demonstrate the validity of the system some liquids are measured. The experimental results show the capability of the system detecting differences between all the liquids."
